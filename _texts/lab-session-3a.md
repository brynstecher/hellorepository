## Footnotes

[^fn1]: I was in a group chat where my old bunk mates made hilarious rumors about the director of my camp and the director (the person who I am writing to) wanted to read them. 

[^fn2]: Canteen is at 2:30 p.m. everyday at my camp and it is where the CITs hand out candy to the campers and staff.


[^fn3]: I was in charge of canteen 95% of the summer. 

[^fn4]: Heather is the CIT Coordinator 

[^fn5]: My camp has a rule where staff is not allowed to be on their phones except on our days and nights off. Everyone breaks that rule ahah.
