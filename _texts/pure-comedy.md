- [Taped news anchor: At six]
- [Studio talk: For some reason when I go...]

- The comedy of man starts like this
- Our brains are way too big for our mothers' hips
- And so Nature, she divines this alternative
- We emerged half-formed and hope that whoever greets us on the other end
- Is kind enough to fill us in
- And, babies, that's pretty much how it's been ever since [^fn1]

- Now the miracle of birth leaves a few issues to address
- Like, say, that half of us are periodically iron deficient
- So somebody's got to go kill something while I look after the kids
- I'd do it myself, but what, are you going to get this thing its milk?
- He says as soon as he gets back from the hunt, we can switch
- It's hard not to fall in love with something so helpless
- Ladies, I hope we don't end up regretting this [^fn2] 

- Comedy, now that's what I call pure comedy
- Just waiting until the part where they start to believe
- They're at the center of everything [^fn3]
- And some all-powerful being endowed this horror show with meaning [^fn4]

- Oh, their religions are the best
- They worship themselves yet they're totally obsessed
- With risen zombies, celestial virgins, magic tricks, these unbelievable outfits [^fn5]
- And they get terribly upset
- When you question their sacred texts
- Written by woman-hating epileptics [^fn6]

- Their languages just serve to confuse them [^fn7] 
- Their confusion somehow makes them more sure [^fn8]
- They build fortunes poisoning their offspring
- And hand out prizes when someone patents the cure[^fn9]
- Where did they find these goons they elected to rule them?
- What makes these clowns they idolize so remarkable?[^fn10]
- These mammals are hell-bent on fashioning new gods
- So they can go on being godless animals [^fn11]

- Oh comedy, their illusions they have no choice but to believe [^fn12]
- Their horizons that just forever recede [^fn13]
- And how's this for irony, their idea of being free is a prison of beliefs
- That they never ever have to leave [^fn14]

- Oh comedy, oh it's like something that a madman would conceive! [^fn15]
- The only thing that seems to make them feel alive is the struggle to survive
- But the only thing that they request is something to numb the pain with[^fn16]
- Until there's nothing human left
- Just random matter suspended in the dark [^fn17]
- I hate to say it, but each other's all we got [^fn18]

## Footnotes

[^fn1]: Walking on two legs requires a narrow birth canal. Being smart requires a big brain. A big brain requires a big head. To get around this problem, humans give birth to underdeveloped young who can’t care for themselves. This is known as the obstetrical dilemma hypothesis. It’s popular and compelling, but not necessarily correct.FJM uses this as a metaphor for our knowledge. We’re born fragile, helpless, and impressionable. We’re at the mercy of others to care for us and educate us. If we’re educated by people who can’t or won’t tell us the truth, then we are doomed to remain “babies”.


[^fn2]: Unfortunately, the biological differences between the sexes have contributed to years of gender inequality. Menstruation is the leading cause of iron deficiency anaemia, because the menstrual lining contains haemoglobin. Meat is a good source of iron, but in a hunter-gatherer society, getting some means leaving your children. Babies are completely vulnerable if abandoned. As women produce milk, it makes sense for them to stay and feed the baby rather than go out hunting.Today, the biological pressures have largely been eased. There’s plenty of iron-rich food at the supermarket, and we can keep milk in the fridge. Nonetheless, women still do most of the childcare. This contributes to the wage gap.


[^fn3]: Tillman is lamenting what he sees as the adulteration of the beauty of life. He sees humanity’s progression into indoctrination and self-importance as something of a cruel joke, or “pure comedy.” He appears to be indicting religion, which has often been criticized for enhancing self-importance.The music video also alludes to consumerism with illustrations of people worshiping of kitchen appliances and a painted heart divided by money, food, and products. Consumerism has been labeled as selfish and frivolous, which also enhances self-importance. We are not born with an inflated sense of self but rather adopt it due to our influences, which Tillman finds unfortunate to say the least.

[^fn4]: Continuing his lament, Tillman lambastes the teaching of the existence of a God who provides our lives with meaning.The music video features footage of neighborhoods devastated by a tornado. This connects to the concept of a “horror show” being endowed with meaning since natural disasters are commonly referred to acts of God. Tillman appears to show disdain for teaching children to view disasters and consequent deaths as part of God’s plan. Interspersed with imagery of an industrial plant emitting air pollution, Tillman could also be criticizing the denial of climate change in conservative religions.

[^fn5]: While FJM believes that humanity is selfish, he also sardonically points out our fixation with religion and spirituality using four examples found most commonly in Christianity:
	1. Risen zombies: While you might think FJM is talking about undead flesh eaters, he’s actually talking about the Christian concept of the resurrection of the dead. In the Bible, both Jesus Christ and Lazarus, a follower of Jesus, were resurrected after being dead.

	2. Celestial virgins: Mary became pregnant with Jesus without having sex, making her a “celestial” (heavenly or sacred) virgin.

	3. Magic tricks: The Bible is full of what its authors refer to as miracles, including Jesus turning water into wine, healing the sick, and feeding a multitude with only five loaves of bread.

	4. Unbelievable outfits: Clergy members in some sects of Christianity wear sacred clothing to symbolize their role.



[^fn6]: Continuing his critique of religion, FJM points out that the authors of sacred texts often taught and wrote things that many would consider sexist.For example, the Bible has some controversial verses about women from the apostle Paul:

	"I do not permit a woman to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet"

	FJM refers to these authors as epileptics because some members of religious sects, such as charismatic Christians and and Sufi Muslims, who reach a state of ecstasy during religious worship services shout, speak in tongues, dance or move in response. The music video for “Pure Comedy” features footage from inside a church with members raising and waving their arms. This could also be a reference to the assumption that Apostle Paul suffered from epilepsy.

[^fn7]: This could possibly be in reference to three things:

	1. The Tower of Babel, which continues the references to religion. The Tower of Babel is an Abrahamic story which serves to explain the origin of the different languages throughout the world.

	2. The difficulty of learning a new language. English for example, is a hard language to learn because of its multiple word origins, its grammar, and many contradictions within its own grammar establishment.

	3. Religious texts purposefully leave room for interpretation, rather than saying anything directly. These interpretations only strengthen the faith of many religious people.


[^fn8]: The previous line and this one are about how religious texts are completely vague and full of flourishes that only confuse people more. The vagueness gives room for people to overlay their own interpretations and call it the word of god, preferring to have their mind made up instead of admitting that their sacred texts could have ambiguous meaning. A strong feeling of faith is more assuring and easily spread than a vague one. This is the Backfire effect; when presented with conflicting information which disagrees with one’s beliefs, despite the truth of the conflicting information, a person will only develop a stronger belief in their erroneous conclusion.

[^fn10]: FJM explained these lines in a Beats 1 Interview:

	"When I started writing this album I just felt really aware of the failure of political solutions for the human experience. And when I wrote ‘these goons they elected to rule them,’ that goes beyond the political elect who rules us in a million different ways day in and day out. We give people power over us in an infinite number of ways before you even get to politics. I think that we absolve ourselves of a certain personal responsibility via politics. It’s kind of a stand-in for the much harder decisions about the way we want to live and who we want to have control" 

[^fn11]: He’s definitely talking about ideology here, not materialism. The next verse is directly talking about ideology (prison of beliefs). Ideology gives you a rinse & repeat way to look at the world, & makes you feel like you know how everything works – which is important to people since “god is dead” and the other alternative in life is meaningless. This theme is continued later in the song when FJM references Nietzsche’s “Parable of the Madman,” where the death of God is first mentioned. He sings, “Comedy, oh its like something that a madman would conceive.”

 
[^fn12]: Tillman is directly referring to children whose religious beliefs, which he calls illusions, are a consequence of circumstance rather than of their own inclination towards particular beliefs. The music video of “Pure Comedy” features a clip from the The Oprah Winfrey Show of child street preacher Duffey Strode screaming Bible verses. In the episode, the boy is subsequently asked for his own interpretation of the verses he had recited but is unable to formulate an original answer. This connects to Tillman’s verse since the boy seems to “have no choice but to believe” in the beliefs his father had impressed upon him.

[^fn13]: Narrow-minded individuals will just continue to shun the truth and choose live in ignorance forever. The hope that they will ever “see the light” just get’s further and further away.


[^fn14]: Confirmation bias causes us to discard information that goes against our existing beliefs. We even choose our friends and hobbies according to our existing beliefs.

Many belief systems preach the value of freedom: we need to be able to make autonomous decisions without interference. Ironically, once we are welded to our ideas, confirmation bias reduces our freedom to choose them, and even controls huge amount of our daily lives.

It’s like when Socrates called himself ignorant just so the other person showed his own ignorance by rendering what should be right or wrong but, in the case, the “Freedom Preachers” who taught liberty are shown as clowns in the end, chained to their own arrogance.


[^fn15]: Our existence is “pure comedy,” and FJM argues that this is a sick joke that only a madman could have come up with. While this is not a direct reference, there is an archetypal parallel worth pointing out between this song and Nietzsche’s “Parable of the Madman”, where he first discusses the “death of God.”

By the late 1800s, the objective claims of the bible had been undermined by science. Nietzsche predicted that people would replace “God” with either nihilism or ideology. Considering the Nazi and Soviet regimes, this proved to be true. Even to this day, it is evident that ideology has taken the place religion use to have in society (e.g. the Alt Right & Social Justice Warriors).

The “madman” in the “Parable of the Madman” staggered around his town yelling:

	"God is dead… all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves?""

The “madman” label was given ironically by Nietzsche to the character, as the character seemed like a madman to the people who heard his cries. In this vein, FJM adopts the personae of Nietzsche’s “madman” & proclaims that existence is pure comedy – We finding meaning in life either though objective belief in God or by imprisoning ourselves in ideology; or even worse, deny that life has any meaning at all.

[^fn16]: The first line here is ironic considering the previous line in the song, which references the “Parable of the Madman" where Nietzsche’s character announces the death of God. “The struggle to survive” means to suffer. The thing that most major religions have taught is that life is suffering! These ideas come to a standstill in the next line. Since the “death of God,” people have become nihilistic and look to either ideology or drugs and alcohol to combat their nihilism.

[^fn17]: What makes us human is that we have limitations & therefore we suffer. By using drugs & alcohol to rid ourselves of our suffering we simultaneously rid ourselves of our humanity.

 [^fn18]: An important concept in this song is, yes, we are fooled by objective belief in religion, but we are also divided by ideology. We have to move past these barriers and cooperate to make sure that the comedy of our existence doesn’t turn into a tragedy.
